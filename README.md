## Features

* **Unified GraphQL Endpoint:** Provides a single, consistent API for all SnapLife client applications.
* **Microservice Orchestration:** Seamlessly integrates with and orchestrates data from multiple backend microservices.
* **Type-Safe Development:** Leverages TypeScript for robust and maintainable code.
* **Apollo Server:** Utilizes the powerful and flexible Apollo Server for GraphQL implementation.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Integrates with the Authentication Service to secure API access.

## Technologies Used

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
* **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
* **Apollo Server:** Production-ready, open-source GraphQL server.
* **GraphQL:** Query language for your API.
* **Express.js (or similar):** Web framework for Node.js (often used with Apollo Server).
* **Dotenv:** For managing environment variables.
* **Axios (or similar):** Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to backend microservices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Yarn (package manager)
* Access to the following backend microservices:
    * Organization Service API
    * Company Service API
    * User Service API
    * Authentication Service API

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/snaplife/snaplife-graphql-service.git
    cd snaplife-graphql-service
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env.example` file. This file will contain your environment-specific configurations, including the URLs of the backend microservices.

Example `.env` file:

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control.

### Running Locally

To start the GraphQL service in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

### AWS Lambda Deployment

This service can be deployed as an AWS Lambda function with API Gateway.

#### Option 1: Manual Deployment

1. **Build and package:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy to AWS Lambda:**
   - Upload `lambda-deployment.zip` to AWS Lambda
   - Set handler to `lambda.handler`
   - Set runtime to Node.js 18.x
   - Configure API Gateway to proxy all requests

#### Option 2: Serverless Framework

1. **Install Serverless:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:lambda
   serverless deploy
   ```

#### Option 3: AWS SAM
